# GitHub Issue Templates Guide

This guide explains how to use the issue templates to request changes to the Mergington High School Activities system.

## Why Use Issue Templates?

Issue templates help you provide all the necessary information for developers (including GitHub Copilot coding agents) to understand and implement your request without needing to ask follow-up questions. This makes the process faster and more efficient.

## Available Templates

When you create a new issue, you'll see several template options:

### 1. 🚀 Feature Request
Use this when you want to add **new functionality** to the system.

**Examples:**
- Adding a calendar view for activities
- Adding new filter options
- Creating a new way to view or organize activities

**Key sections you'll fill out:**
- **Problem Description**: What challenge are you trying to solve?
- **Proposed Solution**: What specifically do you want added?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How will we know when it's done correctly?

### 2. 🐛 Bug Report
Use this when something is **broken or not working correctly**.

**Examples:**
- Registration button doesn't work
- Activities don't display correctly
- Login fails with an error

**Key sections you'll fill out:**
- **Bug Description**: What's wrong?
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior**: What should happen vs what actually happens?
- **Steps to Reproduce**: How can we recreate the problem?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: What needs to work for the bug to be fixed?

### 3. 🎨 UI/UX Enhancement
Use this when you want to improve the **look, feel, or user experience**.

**Examples:**
- Changing colors to match school colors
- Adding mascot images
- Improving button placement or layout
- Making the site more mobile-friendly

**Key sections you'll fill out:**
- **Current State**: What does it look like now?
- **Problem or Concern**: Why does this need to change?
- **Proposed Change**: What should it look like instead?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: What visual changes must be made?

### 4. 📝 Documentation Update
Use this when **documentation is outdated, incorrect, or missing**.

**Examples:**
- README doesn't describe current features
- Setup instructions are out of date
- Missing documentation for a feature

**Key sections you'll fill out:**
- **Documentation Location**: Which file needs updating?
- **Problem Description**: What's wrong with the current docs?
- **Proposed Content**: What should the docs say instead?

### 5. 📊 Activity Data Update
Use this to **add, update, or remove activities or data** in the system.

**Examples:**
- Adding a new club or activity
- Updating activity times or locations
- Changing activity categories

**Key sections you'll fill out:**
- **Type of Update**: What kind of data change?
- **Activity Details**: Specific information about the activity
- **Reason for Change**: Why is this needed?

## How to Create an Issue

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in the GitHub repository
2. Click the green **"New issue"** button
3. Choose the template that best fits your request
4. Fill out all **required fields** (marked with a red asterisk *)
5. Fill out optional fields if you have additional information
6. Click **"Submit new issue"**

## Tips for Writing Good Issues

### Be Specific
❌ Bad: "Make it look better"
✅ Good: "Change the primary color to lime green (#32CD32) to match our school colors"

### Include Acceptance Criteria
Always list what must be true when the work is complete:
- [ ] Color changed to lime green
- [ ] Changes work on mobile devices
- [ ] Dark mode still works correctly

### Provide Context
Help developers understand WHY the change is needed:
- Who is affected? (students, teachers, parents)
- What problem does this solve?
- When is this needed?

### Add Examples When Possible
- Screenshots of the current state
- Mockups of what you want
- Links to similar features on other sites
- Error messages or console output

## What Happens After You Submit?

1. A developer or GitHub Copilot coding agent will be assigned
2. They will review your issue and ask questions if anything is unclear
3. They will implement the changes
4. You'll be notified when the work is complete
5. You can test the changes and provide feedback

## Need Help?

If you're unsure which template to use or need assistance:
- Review the examples in each template description
- Look at previously submitted issues for guidance
- Ask a fellow teacher or administrator
- Contact technical support

## Remember

- **You don't need to know how to code** - just describe what you need clearly
- **The templates guide you** - they ask for exactly what's needed
- **Be as detailed as possible** - more information = faster implementation
- **It's okay to attach files** - screenshots, documents, or other files help explain your request
